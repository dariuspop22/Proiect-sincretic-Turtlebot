# **TurtleBot3 - Autonomous Soccer Robot 🤖⚽**  

This project implements an **autonomous soccer-playing TurtleBot3** using **ROS2**, equipped with **computer vision and motion control** to detect, track, and score goals with a ball.

---

## **🚀 Features**
✔️ **Detects the ball** using computer vision (OpenCV + ROS2).  
✔️ **Moves autonomously** towards the ball and adjusts its trajectory.  
✔️ **Aligns with the goal** before making a shot.  
✔️ **Pushes the ball** toward the goal to score.  
✔️ **If the ball is lost, it searches for it again** and resumes play.

## **🔧 Technologies Used**
- **ROS2 (Humble/Galactic)** – Robotic framework  
- **Gazebo** – Robot simulation  
- **OpenCV** – Image processing for ball detection  
- **Python / C++** – ROS2 node implementation  
- **YOLO / HSV Filtering** – Ball detection algorithms
